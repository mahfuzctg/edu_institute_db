This project demonstrates working with PostgreSQL, focusing on creating tables, performing CRUD operations, and querying data using various SQL techniques such as JOINs, aggregation, and more.

## PostgreSQL Q&A

### 1. What is PostgreSQL?
- PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its scalability, SQL compliance, and support for advanced data types and functions.

### 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
- A schema in PostgreSQL organizes and structures database objects like tables, views, and indexes. It separates data into logical groups to avoid naming conflicts and improve database management.

### 3. Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.
- **Primary Key**: A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A column in one table that references the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

### 4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?
- **VARCHAR**: A variable-length string that can hold up to a specified number of characters. It only uses space equal to the length of the stored string.
- **CHAR**: A fixed-length string that always uses space for the full defined length, padding with spaces if necessary.

### 5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.
- The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows in a query based on specific conditions, allowing you to retrieve only the data that meets the criteria.

### 6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?
- `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned by a query.
- `OFFSET` specifies the starting point for the rows to be returned, skipping the first set of rows.

### 7. How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?
- The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records in a table. You can specify which rows to update by using the `WHERE` clause and define new values for the columns.

### 8. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?
- The `JOIN` operation combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Common types include `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`, used to retrieve data that matches or doesn't match between tables.

### 9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows with the same values in specified columns and allows for performing aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) on each group.

### 10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?
- Aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` are used in queries to calculate the total number of rows, the sum of values, and the average value of a column, respectively.

### 11. What is the purpose of an index in PostgreSQL, and how does it optimize query performance?
- An index in PostgreSQL is a data structure that improves query performance by allowing the database to find rows faster than scanning the entire table. It reduces the time for search and retrieval operations.

### 12. Explain the concept of a PostgreSQL view and how it differs from a table.
- A view in PostgreSQL is a virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query. Unlike a table, it does not store data physically but provides a dynamic view of the data stored in tables.
